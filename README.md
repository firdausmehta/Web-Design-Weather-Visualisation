## Outline
Created individual pages for each weather plot and a means by which you can navigate between them. These pages contain visualisations and their corresponding explanations. There is also a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

The website consists of 7 pages total, including:

* A [landing page](#landing-page) containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualisations page. There is a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image will take the user to that visualisation.
* Four [visualization pages](#visualization-pages), each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualisation itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* A ["Comparisons" page](#comparisons-page) that:
  * Contains all of the visualisations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
  * Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualisations.
* A ["Data" page](#data-page) that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
